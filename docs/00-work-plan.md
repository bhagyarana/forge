# 00 · Work Plan

> **What this is.** The one file that answers _"where are we, and what is next?"_ — for the documentation re-aim and for the build that follows.
> **Ritual.** Update the status column in the same commit as the work. A plan that lags the repo is worse than no plan, because people trust it.

## 2. The four decisions that set the direction

Taken 4 Sep 2026, before Batch 1 was written. Each has an ADR.

## 3. Documentation batches

Five batches. **Each ends at a checkpoint where the user reviews before the next begins** — that is the ritual, not a formality. A batch that has not been reviewed does not get built on.

### ✅ Batch 1 — Foundation re-aim · _complete_

The _why_ and the _what_. Everything downstream cites these.

|       | Document                                                                                                                                         | Status       |

| B1.9  | [README.md](README.md) — the documentation entry point, rewritten around the new set                                                             | ✅ rewritten |
| B1.10 | `deferred/design-intelligence.md` — the old doc 09, moved intact                                                                                 | ✅ moved     |

**Checkpoint C1 — review Batch 1.** Confirm the pipeline shape, the requirement set and the four decisions. Everything after this builds on them, so a correction here is cheap and a correction at C3 is not.

How the pieces fit. The batch that produces the diagram a judge will stare at.

| B2.3 | [02-architecture/06-agent-contracts.md](02-architecture/06-agent-contracts.md)         | **Rewrite of the old tool contracts.** The `runAgentLoop()` harness, the terminal tool and forced close, per-sub-agent contracts, the no-throw law, the least-privilege tool registry, budgets and ceilings.                                                                                                                                                             | ✅ renamed + rewritten |

**Checkpoint C2 — passed.** Architecture and data model reviewed and merged to `main` before any algorithm was specified against them.

**Carried from C2, still needs a ruling:** [04 §3.4](02-architecture/04-system-architecture.md) proposes deriving the process exit code from the terminal state **and** the findings, so that a completed run which found a real defect exits `1`. `FR-904` currently maps the four terminal states to `0/0/2/3` with no non-zero code for a found defect, which contradicts `S-4`. Either `FR-904`'s acceptance criterion takes a one-line amendment, or `S-4` is reworded. One of the two must move.

**Checkpoint C3 — passed.** Algorithms reviewed and merged before any build document was written against them.

**Ruled at C3:** the veto-to-case map in [13 §10](03-algorithms/13-triage-and-healing.md) — `V1`,`V2` → `EC-06`, `V3` → `EC-05`, `V4` → `EC-04`, `V5` → `EC-07` — **stands**, and [16 §5](04-build/16-agent-test-suite.md) implements it exactly. `EC-06` now proves `V1` _alone_, using a new non-numeric assertion defect (`M-12`), which is a stronger test than the pre-brief pairing.

**Raised at C4, already applied:** writing the assertions before the code surfaced a defect in [13 §3](03-algorithms/13-triage-and-healing.md). As ordered, row 1 (`V1`) intercepts every input that could reach row 2 (`V3`), so `V3` could never fire. The pre-classifier now takes the **first** match for `kind`/`confidence`/`final` and collects **every** matching row's veto id — a one-line amendment, already made, recorded in [16 §11.1](04-build/16-agent-test-suite.md).

**Also raised at C4, resolved in Batch 5:** four pre-brief delivery documents were replaced by the canonical `20`–`23` set. ADRs remain permanent records and were retained.

## 4. Build phases

Written now so the documentation batches know what they are feeding. Detailed in `05-delivery/20-execution-plan.md` (Batch 5).

**The floor** — if everything else is cut, these still ship: URL in → explore → plan → critique → generate → run → classify → report, on one target, with the refuse-to-heal case working. That is every hard MUST plus the strongest Bonus.

### 4.1 Where the build stands

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ph0** Pre-flight | ✅ done — empty workspace, guardrails, CI green                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Ph1** Spine      | ✅ done — schemas, store, the FSM and its eleven guards, `runAgentLoop()`, the API/SSE shell, and the eval harness (`STUB-01`) all pass `pnpm verify`. **`packages/core/schema` is frozen as of this commit** — per [15 §3.1](04-build/15-repo-and-conventions.md) and this file's working agreement 5, no further edits to `packages/core/schema/**` without a documented reason and a matching migration. |

Ph1 also fixed a latent bug in `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` found while building it: `exclude: "node_modules|…"` was silently dropping every graph edge to an npm package (not just hiding node_modules' own internals), which meant `one-model-client` — the rule that is supposed to prove "only the harness talks to the model" — could never fire. Fixed by excluding only `dist`/`.next` and using `doNotFollow` for `node_modules` instead, and by correcting `one-model-client`'s path pattern to match pnpm's `node_modules/.pnpm/…` virtual-store layout rather than a flat `node_modules/@scope/…` one. Verified live by planting a second `@anthropic-ai/sdk` import and confirming the rule caught it before removing the plant.

## 5. Working agreements

Six rules. They exist because hour six is when discipline is worth the most and costs the most.

1. **One task, one branch, one gate, one commit.** No task is done until `pnpm verify` is green.
2. **Docs and code change together.** A behaviour change with no doc edit fails review; the docs are the spec, not a description.
3. **IDs are permanent** from Checkpoint C1 onward. Never renumber, never reuse. Superseding an ADR means a new number and a `Superseded by` line on the old one.
4. **`grep` before you rename.** Every ID is cited across four or five documents.
5. **The schema is frozen at the end of Ph1.** One Zod edit after that invalidates work in three places at once.
6. **Simplicity is a gate, not a preference.** If a component cannot be explained in three sentences, it is wrong. Complexity fails; simplicity scales.

Why renumber at all: the numbers exist to give reading order. The pipeline changed shape, so the reading order changed. Numbers that no longer order anything are worse than no numbers — and this is the last cheap moment to fix it, because no external artefact cites them yet.

Plan assumes work can be split three ways; collapses cleanly to one                                                                                                                   |
| `W-4` | Is `@playwright/mcp` worth a subprocess, or do we call Playwright directly?                                                                                                                                 | Batch 2           | ✅ **Resolved** — direct. We need Playwright in-process regardless; MCP would add a second browser stack for one stage. [ADR-016](decisions/ADR-016-perception-transport.md)                   |
| `W-5` | Exit code for a completed run that found a real defect — amend `FR-904`, or reword `S-4`?                                                                                                                   | **Checkpoint C4** | ✅ Resolved — completed runs with findings exit `1`; `EC-05`, `EC-06`, and `EC-07` assert it ([16 §11.5](04-build/16-agent-test-suite.md)).                                                    |
| `W-6` | Should any external validation platform ([target-apps/external-platforms.md](target-apps/external-platforms.md)) ever be promoted into the canonical roster as a `T4`/`T5`, or wired into the `EC-nn` gate? | Post-hackathon    | ⬜ Open. Not required for the floor — supplementary and non-canonical by design ([target-apps/external-platforms.md §2](target-apps/external-platforms.md))                                    |
